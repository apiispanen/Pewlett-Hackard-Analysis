# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Investigations in data structure analysis.

# Summary
This analysis is to aid Bobby's manager in looking for employees who are close to retiring. By discovering this trend early, management can take necessary action early and can prevent anything like this from occurring in the future. 

The purpose of this analysis is to find the following bits of information: 
1.  Determine the number of retiring employees by title.
To do this, we need to make a "Retirement Titles" table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. This
2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
To do this, we made a "mentorship-eligibility" table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
