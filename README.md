# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Investigations in employee databases.

# Summary
This analysis is to aid Bobby's manager in looking for employees who are close to retiring. By discovering this trend early, management can take necessary action early and can prevent anything like this from occurring in the future. 

The purpose of this analysis is to find the following bits of information: 
1.  Determine the number of retiring employees by title.
To do this, we need to make a "Retirement Titles" table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. This
2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
To do this, we made a "mentorship-eligibility" table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

# Results
During or analysis, we came across the following findings:
- There are a startling number of senior staff members who would be at risk of leaving soon. Senior engineers and senior staff had 29,414 employees and 28,254 employees, respectively. Higher-up positions like this are much harder to replace, and require a lot more training to fill.

# Summary
<!-- Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? -->
## The "Silver Tsunami"
Based on our analysis, there are 90,398 employee positions that would need to be filled to accommodate the soon-to-be retiring employees. From our analysis on mentorship eligibility, there were 1,549 eligible employees who could help train new hires. Since this many employees will be leaving and so few employees will be of "training eligibility", there is just not enough help to transition new employees into the company successfully. Pewlett-Hackard should consider giving greater incentives for employees of retiring ages who choose not to retire, or even consider outsourcing certain departments to contractors who are already experienced in certain areas, in order to prevent a gap in employee support. 

To aid in this whole analysis, the following tables could be constructed:
